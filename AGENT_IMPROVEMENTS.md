# Loan Agent Improvements

## Overview

The loan agent system has been significantly improved to enhance Python coding capabilities and data analysis accuracy. This document outlines the key improvements made to `utils_simple.py`.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Fixed System Prompt Issues

**Problem**: The original system prompt referenced `fetch_data` action but the actual tool was `python_calculator`.

**Solution**: 
- Updated all examples to use `python_calculator` action
- Provided clear Python coding guidelines
- Added comprehensive examples showing proper data analysis patterns
- Added specific example for counting unique managers to prevent common errors

### 2. Enhanced Python Tool Safety

**Problem**: The original `python_calculator` used unsafe `eval()` execution.

**Solution**:
- Implemented safe execution environment with restricted namespace
- Added proper error handling and logging with specific error types (SyntaxError, NameError)
- Included all necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, math, statistics, datetime)
- Better error messages for debugging
- Added validation to ensure data is loaded before analysis

### 3. Improved Data Analysis Examples

**Problem**: Examples were generic and didn't reflect actual data structure.

**Solution**:
- Created 7 comprehensive examples covering different analysis types:
  1. **Top Performing Manager**: Shows how to find best performing manager by total payments
  2. **Portfolio Statistics**: Comprehensive portfolio overview with multiple metrics
  3. **Arrears Analysis**: Detailed analysis of clients with outstanding payments
  4. **Loan Product Analysis**: Product popularity and performance analysis
  5. **Manager Performance Comparison**: Multi-metric manager comparison
  6. **Count Unique Managers**: Simple example for counting unique values (prevents common errors)
  7. **Count Unique Clients**: Example for counting unique clients using correct column name

### 4. Better Python Coding Guidelines

Added clear guidelines for the model:
- Always import required libraries first
- Use proper pandas operations (groupby, agg, sort_values)
- Handle missing data appropriately
- Format numbers correctly for business context
- Return results as formatted strings for HTML integration
- Use multiple lines separated by semicolons for complex operations
- Examples: 
  - Simple: `len(pd.read_csv('processed_data.csv'))`
  - Complex: `df = pd.read_csv('processed_data.csv'); top_manager = df.groupby('Managed_By')['Total_Paid'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(1); manager_name = top_manager.index[0]; manager_name`
- Do NOT use import statements, newlines, comments, or multi-line formatting
- Use correct column names: Client_Code (not Client), Managed_By, Total_Paid, etc.

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling

**Improvements**:
- Better error detection in response processing
- Graceful fallback for different response types
- Improved logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages
- Specific validation for newlines and comments that cause syntax errors
- Column name validation to catch common mistakes (Client vs Client_Code)

## Example Improvements

### Before (Problematic):
```
Action: fetch_data
Action Input: SELECT Managed_By, SUM(`Total Paid`) FROM df GROUP BY Managed_By ORDER BY SUM(`Total Paid`) DESC LIMIT 1
```

### After (Correct):
```
Action: python_calculator
Action Input: import pandas as pd; df = pd.read_csv('processed_data.csv'); top_manager = df.groupby('Managed_By')['Total_Paid'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(1); manager_name = top_manager.index[0]; total_paid = top_manager.iloc[0]; f"Manager: {manager_name}, Total Paid: {total_paid:,.2f}"
```

## Data Structure Awareness

The improved system now properly handles the actual CSV structure:

- **processed_data.csv**: Main analysis file with columns like `Managed_By`, `Loan_No`, `Loan_Product_Type`, `Client_Code`, `Client_Name`, `Issued_Date`, `Amount_Disbursed`, `Installments`, `Total_Paid`, `Total_Charged`, `Arrears`, etc.
- **loans.csv**: Individual loan details
- **ledger.csv**: Payment transactions
- **clients.csv**: Client information

## Testing

Use the provided test script to verify improvements:

```bash
python test_improved_agent.py
```

This will test various queries to ensure the agent can:
- Calculate portfolio statistics
- Find top performers
- Analyze arrears
- Compare managers
- Analyze loan products

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: Correct data analysis using proper Python pandas operations
2. **Safety**: Secure code execution environment
3. **Reliability**: Better error handling and fallback mechanisms
4. **Usability**: Clear examples and guidelines for the model
5. **Maintainability**: Well-documented improvements and structure

## Usage

The improved agent can now handle complex queries like:

- "What is our total loan portfolio value?"
- "Which manager has the highest performance rate?"
- "How many clients have arrears and what's the total amount?"
- "Show me the most popular loan product with its performance metrics"
- "Calculate the average loan size by manager"

The system will use the `python_calculator` tool to perform proper data analysis and return professionally formatted HTML responses.
